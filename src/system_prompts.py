# Enhanced few-shot examples for Azure Synapse
ENHANCED_FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = """
CRITICAL DATE HANDLING RULES FOR AZURE SYNAPSE:
1. Use GETDATE() instead of CURDATE() for current date
2. Use YEAR(date_column) = YEAR(GETDATE()) for year-to-date queries
3. Use MONTH(date_column) = MONTH(GETDATE()) AND YEAR(date_column) = YEAR(GETDATE()) for this month
4. Use DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE()) for last 30 days
5. Use DATEPART(QUARTER, date_column) = 1/2/3/4 for quarters

CONTEXT AWARENESS RULES:
1. ONLY use previous context when explicitly indicated in the prompt
2. When user says "next 10", "more", "continue" - use TOP with OFFSET based on previous query
3. When user refers to "that customer", "this product" - use the entity from the last query
4. For independent queries, ignore all previous context and generate fresh SQL
5. Track pagination state for list queries only when context is needed

DATA TYPE COMPATIBILITY RULES:
1. Never mix incompatible data types in UNION operations
2. Use CAST/CONVERT to ensure data type consistency
3. For mixed result sets, use separate queries or proper data type conversion
4. Always ensure all SELECT columns have compatible data types

AZURE SYNAPSE SPECIFIC RULES:
1. Use TOP instead of LIMIT for result limiting
2. Use SQL Server syntax for functions and operations
3. Tables available: sales_data, customer_data, sapproduct
4. Always use proper schema prefix (dbo.) when referencing tables

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
- "What is today's date?" → SELECT GETDATE() AS TodaysDate (NO CONTEXT)
- "Show me sales for Fanta" → Generate product-specific query (NO CONTEXT)
- "Show me more results" → Use OFFSET from previous query (USE CONTEXT)
- "What about that customer?" → Use customer from previous query (USE CONTEXT)

**CONTEXTUAL QUERY EXAMPLES:**
Example 1:
Previous Query: "Show me last 5 orders of FATHIMA GROCERY"
Previous SQL: SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.sales_data WHERE CustomerName = 'FATHIMA GROCERY' ORDER BY OrderDate DESC
User Query: "also show me first 5"
Generated SQL: SELECT TOP 5 * FROM dbo.sales_data WHERE CustomerName = 'FATHIMA GROCERY' ORDER BY OrderDate ASC

Example 2:
Previous Query: "Show sales for Sprite Zero"
Previous SQL: SELECT * FROM dbo.sales_data WHERE ProductDesc LIKE '%Sprite Zero%'
User Query: "plot a pie chart for orders across different order sources"
Generated SQL: SELECT OrderSource, COUNT(*) as OrderCount FROM dbo.sales_data WHERE ProductDesc LIKE '%Sprite Zero%' GROUP BY OrderSource

**CHART REQUEST EXAMPLES:**
- "plot a pie chart" → Generate GROUP BY query to get categorical data
- "show a bar chart" → Generate aggregation query
- "visualize trend" → Generate time-series query
